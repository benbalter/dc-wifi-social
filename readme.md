## How to contribute

1. Fork the project
2. Add or edit a location by editing and following the format in `boston_hx.geojson` (hint, it's geoJSON)
3. Submit a pull request

## How to locate a place of interest

Use one of the websites listed in [resources](resources.txt). You aren't limited to the histories here, by any means! Also, you might have to do a slight bit of digging, google-map discovery to get an address.

## How to find the lat/long of an address.

Pop it into http://geocoder.us/. Boom.

## Why?

To practice git & github.

Instructions on validation from the original DC-wife project:
## Validating the geoJSON

When you submit a pull request, it will automatically check to ensure your geoJSON is valid.

If you'd like to check yourself, you can run `./script/cibuild` locally, or pasting the contents of `bars.geojson` into http://geojsonlint.com.
