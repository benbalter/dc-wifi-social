## How to contribute

1. Fork the project
2. Add or edit a location by editing and following the format in `bars.geojson` (hint, it's geoJSON)
3. Submit a pull request

## Validating the geoJSON

When you submit a pull request, it will automatically check to ensure your geoJSON is valid.

If you'd like to check yourself, you can run `./script/cibuild` locally, or pasting the contents of `bars.geojson` into http://geojsonlint.com.

## How to find the lat/long of a location

Pop it into http://geocoder.us/. Boom.

## Why?

Don't ask such questions.
